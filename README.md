# Basic Anti Cheat
If you can bypass this, congratulations. I purposefully kept code simple and non-invasive, never going past ring 3.

# Log Files
This program also creats log files in your machines appdata roaming folder. Each log file is named by the unix time stamp swim prevent was started. Log files contain useful information such as USB counts and when swim prevent was closed.
